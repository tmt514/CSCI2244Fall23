## IPython Notebooks

All programming assignments will be in the **IPython Notebook format**(`.ipynb`).
We highly recommend you to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) on your computer.
However, installing Jupyter Notebook locally is not necessary.
Sometimes there could be technical issues (that would be good learning experiences for the hardcore CS stuff).
If you encounter such a situation right before the homework deadlines, there are other options for you.
For example, you can utilize [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which provides basic computing resources in ipython format that suit our needs.

## Typesetting Your Homework Submissions

All mathematical expressions **must be typesetted**.
A badly typesetted submission could get a [desk-rejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_peer_review#:~:text=At%20this%20phase%20many%20articles%20receive%20a%20%22desk%20reject%22%2C%20that%20is%2C%20the%20editor%20chooses%20not%20to%20pass%20along%20the%20article.%20The%20authors%20may%20or%20may%20not%20receive%20a%20letter%20of%20explanation.)
without any credit.
The easiest way to typeset the homeworks in this course is to use [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).
We will provide templates for each homework assignment
and you can utilize [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write down the solutions.

<!-- ## Checkpoint for Lecture 1

=== "Question 1.1"

  What kind of randomness do we concern the most in this course?

  1. I just spoke with a _random_ person on the street.
  2. Hey, your room looks _random_. It needs to be cleaned up.
  3. I don't know what to have for lunch, I will make a _random_ choice.
  4. The weather looks so _random_ today. -->
