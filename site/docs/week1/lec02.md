# Lecture 2 - Discrete Probability Basics

!!! note "Agenda"

    1. Formally define (discrete) probability space for common random objects.
    2. Probability Axioms.
    3. The na√Øve ways of analyzing probability events.
    4. Probability Paradoxes II - The Monty Hall Problem

## Readings

* [Alvarez] Sections 2.1-2.2; 3.1-3.2.

## Important Terms/Notations

* Probability Space: $(\Omega, P)$
* Sample Space: $\Omega$
* Probability Mass Function (PMF): $P$
* (Discrete) Uniform Distribution: _equiprobable outcomes_
* Events: $E\subseteq \Omega$
* Independent Events: $P(E_1\cap E_2) = P(E_1)P(E_2)$
* Random Variables: $X: \Omega\to \mathbb{R}$
* Independent Random Variables: $P(X=x \land Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y)$

## Probability Axioms

* **Non-negativity of probability**: For any event $E$ we have $P(E)\ge 0$.
* **Probability of the sample space**: $P(\Omega)=1$.
* **Countable additivity**: For any countable set of disjoint events $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots\}$ we have

$$\begin{cases}
P(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i) & \text{if the set has finitely many events,}\\
P(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i) & \text{if the set has countably infinite sets.}
\end{cases}
$$

## Naive (But Useful!) Ways of Analyzing Probability Events

* Enumerate the entire sample space.
    * Venn Diagrams
* Drawing trees for coincident independent events.
