# Lecture 3 - More Independent Events

!!! note "Agenda"

    1. When do two random events independent?
    2. Analyzing independent sequential experiments.
    3. Geometric progression.
    4. Discrete probability space with infinite sample space.
    5. Probability Paradox III - The Birthday Paradox


## Readings

* [Alvarez] Sections 2.2.2.

## Examples

* If you sample a five-letter-word from the alphabet, what is the probability where the word is in the form of consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant? (We treat the letter **Y** as a consonant.)
* Suppose you toss a biased coin 50 times independently.
Prove that the probability of the first three coins result in heads is the same as the probability of the last three coins result in heads.
* Suppose you toss a biased coin repeatedly. What is the probability that you see a different side within the first 10 tosses?

## Three Events

* There exists events $A, B, C$ such that $\{A, B, C\}$ are not independent but any pair of them are independent.
