<!-- ## Checkpoint for Lecture 1

=== "Question 1.1"

  What kind of randomness do we concern the most in this course?

  1. I just spoke with a _random_ person on the street.
  2. Hey, your room looks _random_. It needs to be cleaned up.
  3. I don't know what to have for lunch, I will make a _random_ choice.
  4. The weather looks so _random_ today. -->
