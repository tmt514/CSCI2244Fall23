## Grading

* 40% Homeworks: There will be 12 problem sets. The highest 9 PS scores count towards to your homework grade. The typical deadline is 10PM (ET) but I allow submissions up to 11:59PM (ET) on the same day. <b>I do not accept submissions later than 11:59PM. This is a hard constraint, no excuse, sorry.</b> (That's why we dropped 3 PS scores!)
* 15% Exam 1.
* 15% Exam 2.
* 30% Exam 3.

## How To Success

!!! tip "Quote from Prof. Alvarez"

    The not-so-secret recipe for doing well on the exams is to work diligently on the problem sets and to stay up to date on the course material.
